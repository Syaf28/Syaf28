Hi, I'm Syafiq Ubaidillah 👋

I am an upstream scientist with a strong interest in bioprocess research, data analysis, and process optimization.  
My background combines **biotechnology and engineering**, with a growing focus on automation and control systems.

I have hands-on experience and ongoing projects involving:
- Upstream bioprocess development and scale-up
- Fermentation and bioreactor system design
- Process automation using PLC and SCADA systems
- Data analysis and monitoring for process improvement
- Bridging laboratory research with industrial implementation

I enjoy working on practical, engineer-driven solutions that connect research, instrumentation, and software.
